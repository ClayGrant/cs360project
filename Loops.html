<h2>Level 1</h2>
<p>There are two basic kinds of loops, for and while
For loops are used when you know how many times you want to repeat,
and while loops are used when you want to run the loop based off 
of some condition </p>
<code> for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {</br>
//commands to be repeated</br>
} </code>
<p> In this example, a for loop is creaated. A variable i is 
created and set equal to zero. The loop will run, increasing the value of
i each time by 1. The loop will end when i is equal to 10.</p>
<code> int k = 0;</br>
while(k < 10) {</br>
//commands to be repeated</br>
k++;</br>
}</code>
<p> This is a while loop, in a while loop, the code runs as long as 
the conditon (k < 10) is true. You may noticethat we have to manually 
update the value of k in the loop Otherwise the while loop
 will run forever</p>
 <h2>Level 2</h2>
 <p> It is possible to have nested loops, which means a loop
inside of a loop. In this situatation, the entire inner loop
is run for each repetion of the outer loop <p>
<code> for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {</br>
			int i = 0;</br>
			while(i < 5) {</br>
System.out.println("This will be printed 
when j equals " + j + " and when i equals " + i);</br>
i++;</br>
}</br>
}</code>
